/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  WordPress requires a style.css file located in the theme's root folder.

  However, we will not be using vanilla CSS. We're using Sass.

  Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features
  such as variables, nested selectors and loops. It's also
  the easiest way to customize Foundation.

  All Sass files are located in the /assets/scss folder.
  Please note that none of your scss files will be compiled to /stylesheets/foundation.css before you run
  'npm run watch' or 'npm run build'.

  Please read the README.md file before getting started. More info on how
  to use Sass with Foundation can be found here:
  http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html

  If you for some reason would like to write plain css instead of using Sass,
  you could just enqueue this file (style.css) to the header and add your styles in this file
